# HuaRongDao
This is a 3D simulator of the game HuaRongDao, or more widely known as Klotski. 
This was created as the final project for CP411 at Wilfrid Laurier University, a 4th year course with an aim to teach students about the mathematics behind rasterizing a conceptualized graphics object, and the algorithms to do so. The course uses an open, free library called OpenGL, which is what many engines such as Unreal, Unity, and many others use for graphics API in order to interact with hardware.
